# About

Twenty years of experience in applying computational science, numerical
analysis and scientific computing to solve challenging problems in the areas of
medical imaging, organizational behavioral modeling, radio antenna and
high-speed electronic circuit design, video and image processing, financial
analysis, monitoring of manufacturing processes, and performance testing.

## What I Do

I design and implement novel tools to route and analyze data, report results,
synthesize models, simulate outcomes and make decisions. Parallel algorithms
developed by me solve numerical problems of record-breaking scale. Live
exploration is a key aspect of the tools I build, supplementing automated
analysis and reporting with the ability to transform and review calculations on
the fly. I am keenly interested in broadening the applications of numerical and
scientific computing into nontraditional applications and offering unique
insight into a wide range of problems.

## Diversions

In my freetime, I contribute to a some open-source projects. My
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/ahesford) contains forks of some projects I
contribute to or find interesting.

If you are looking for an operating system, I highly recommend
[Void Linux](https://www.voidlinux.org).
