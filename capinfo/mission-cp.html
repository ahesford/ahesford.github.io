NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">During World War II, CAP trained thousands
of young men to fly before they joined the Army Air Forces. This
training, coupled with positive values instilled by role models,
resulted in the AAF having a pool of aviators virtually ready
to do battle.</P>

<P class="normal">After the war, the success of the wartime
cadet program convinced Congress that a peacetime cadet program
would pay great dividends.</P>

<P class="normal">For the past half-century, CAP's Cadet
Programs have provided young people between 11 and 18 the opportunity
to develop their leadership skills through their interest in
aviation. For many, it has also offered them the opportunity
to learn to fly.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><P class="medtext">&quot;Your final mission is the cadet
program. There, your job is to inspire the country'syouth
to become leaders and good citizens through their interest in
aerospace. And to me, that is by far, your most important
mission.&quot;</P>

BORDER="1" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" WIDTH="272" HEIGHT="196" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">A
knowledge of aerospace-related information is one of the pillars
of the program. Cadets progress at their own pace through
a 15-step program including aerospace education, leadership training,
physical fitness and moral leadership.</P>

<P class="normal">As cadets make progress, they have the
opportunity to take part in a wide range of activities including
encampments on military bases, orientation flights, and a variety
of national and international activities.</P>

its National Scholarship Program, CAP provides scholarships to
cadets to further their studies in such areas as engineering,
science, aircraft mechanics and aerospace medicine. Scholarships
leading to solo flight training are also provided.</P>

<P class="normal">The U.S. Air Force recognizes the high
standards the cadets must meet. When CAP cadets enlist in
the Air Force, they now enter as an E-3 (Airman First Class)
instead of as an airman basic.</P>

<P class="normal">CAP cadets are also well represented at
the U.S. Air Force Academy. Usually 8-10 percent of the
academy class is composed of former CAP cadets.</P>
