<P class="normal">The mission of Civil Air Patrol is to voluntarily use its resources to meet civil emergencies, to encourage aerospace education of the general public, and to motivate young men and women to ideals of leadership and service through aerospace education and training.</P>

<P class="largetext">CADET MEMBERSHIP</P>

<P class="normal">Initial membership is open to
young people who are 11 years of age (or in the sixth grade) through
18 years of age. Being a Civil Air Patrol cadet is a rewarding
experience and seeing the program through is an extraordinary
achievement. To qualify for cadet membership each candidate must
be (1) a United States citizen or an alien admitted for permanent
residence; (2) of good moral character; (3) a graduate of or be
enrolled in a private or public school and maintaining satisfactory
progress; (4) single; (5) not a member of the armed forces on
active duty.</P>

<P class="largetext">THE CADET PROGRAM</P>

<P class="normal">The CAP cadet program is divided
into five phases. The first is an Introductory, or Motivation,
phase during which the prospective cadet becomes acquainted with
the procedures, requirements, and goals of CAP. Beyond the Motivation
Phase there are four numbered phases in the CAP cadet program.
The entire cadet program is oriented toward an activities program
held within the individual squadron setting. Activities selected
by a squadron for its program are designed to meet the individual
member&#146;s need. Our squadron has a Color Guard, Orientation
Flight program, Flight Simulator Training, Tours, and numerous
leadership exercises.</P>

<P class="normal">Throughout the cadet program,
from cadet basic through the Spaatz Award, emphasis is placed
on individualized study, instruction and attainment. Each of the
phases of the cadet program emphasizes five areas of achievement:
aerospace education, moral leadership, leadership laboratory,
squadron activities and physical fitness. These five factors are
implemented through the use of counselors who work individually
with each cadet desiring and needing assistance. Instruction and
motivation are provided at the squadron but it is up to the cadet
on just how far they want to go.</P>
