I wanted to get into the USAFand fly, but because of a vision problem(I only missed the chart by one line, even with glasses) i  was unable to.  I find CAP the next best thing.  I  am now a college student in Florida and it is always weloming experience to go home on "leave" and visit my friends at WV-060.  Even though i could not get in USAF my heart is truely there, and for those of you who are, you are special unique people who I wish i could be a part of--enough for now...Hi WV-060   keep up the good work. <HR>
