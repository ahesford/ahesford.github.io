<P class="normal"><IMG SRC="images/slogan.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="1" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" WIDTH="196" HEIGHT="123" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">For more than 50 years, the Civil Air Patrol has aggressively performed the missions Congress mandated in 1946: Aerospace Education, Cadet Programs, and Emergency Services.</P>

<P class="normal"><B>Aerospace Education</B></P>
<P class="normal">America's love of manned flight started
with the Wright brothers and continues unabated during this century. World
War II showcased the important role aviation would play in the
future and national leaders recognized the importance of stimulating
public interest in aerospace activities.</P>
<IMG SRC="images/nhq.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="1" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">
<P class="normal">CAP, as the civilian Auxiliary of the U.S.
Air Force, was most suited to perform this mission. Their
efforts focused on two different audiences - internal CAP members
and the general public.</P>
<P class="normal">The internal programs ensure that all CAP
members (seniors and cadets) have an appreciation for and knowledge
of aerospace issues. A rigorous educational program is tied
to promotions at every level in the CAP organization.</P>
<P class="normal">Aerospace educators working out of CAP's
National Headquarters at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, provide materials
that are current and reflect the highest standards of educational
excellence.</P>
<P class="normal">The congressional charter also tasked CAP
to stimulate public interest in aerospace issues. These
external programs are primarily conducted through our nation's
education systems.</P>
<P class="normal">Each year, CAP sponsors nearly 200 workshops
in colleges and universities across the nation which reach more
than 5,000 educators.</P>

<P class="normal">These workshops highlight basic aerospace
knowledge and focus on advances in aerospace technology. Textbooks,
learning tools, and visual aids geared to stimulate interest
in aerospace matters also are provided for teachers to use in
their classrooms.</P>
<P class="normal">Started in 1951, these workshops have reached
hundreds of thousands of young people.</P>

  of our air strength and our pilots and navigators of tomorrow...We
  must pass on our air experience -- not only in the AirForces,
  but in every section of the country.&quot;</P>

  <P class="normal">CAP also plans and executes
  the National Congress on Aviation and Space Education. NCASE
  is the premier aerospace education conference held in the nation. The
  NCASE is designed to promote an understanding of aviation and
  space education to motivate and encourage teachers to incorporate
  aerospace education into their curriculum. It also encourages
  aerospace leaders to speak out on aerospace issues facing our
  nation today.</P>
