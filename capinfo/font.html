<P class="normal">The headings of each page appearing in <I>Civil Air Patrol Information</I> were designed in a special font, called EuroseWide Heavy. This is the font appearing on the last two albums by the band Radiohead. If you would like to see the headings as they were intended, click the link below.</P>

<P class="normal">Once you've downloaded this, unzip the file. Remember where you unzip the files.</P>
<P class="normal">Click "Start", point to "Settings", and click "Control Panel" when the menu expands. In the Control Panel, click the "Fonts" icon. Put this window aside for now. Open the folder where you unzipped the font files, and place it next to the "Fonts" folder. Now drag the files from the original folder into the "Fonts" folder. The page should refresh automatically, but if not, do it manually. You should see the headings of every page in a unique font.</P>
<P class="medtext">Macintosh users, sorry, but you'll have to put up with the "Helvetica" font.</P>
