<P class="normal">On 1 December 1941, a brotherhood of civilian pilots was formed. The organization
was designed to harness aviation resources, and aid in times of
conflict. The organization was called the Civil Air Patrol.</P>

<P class="normal">Founded by Gill Robb Wilson and supported
by General Henry Arnold, Civil Air Patrol was the first organization
under the Office of Civilian Defense. During World War II, members
became known as &quot;Minutemen.&quot; Volunteering their time,
they played an important role in World War II. In April 1943,
CAP was reassigned from the Office of Civilian Defense to the
War Department and placed under the command of the Army Air Forces.
Members performed missions including coastal patrol to search
for enemy submarines, search and rescue missions, cargo and courier
flights, and even target-towing so Army Air Corps personnel could
practice air-to-air gunnery techniques, a risky practice with
new gunners. Overall, during Word War II, Civil Air Patrol members
recorded more than 500,000 hours, saved hundreds of crash victims,
and sank two enemy submarines.</P>

<P class="normal">Civil Air Patrol permanently became an Auxiliary
of the United States Air Force on 26 May 1948, when Congress passed
Public Law 557. This law gave the Secretary of the Air Force the
authority to provide financial and material assistance to the
organization.</P>

<P class="normal">Civil Air Patrol has three missions: Aerospace
education, emergency services, and the cadet program. You can
read about these by clicking the "Mission" links on the main page.</P>

<P class="normal">Every year, Civil Air Patrol sponsors workshops
in colleges and universities across the nation. These workshops
highlight basic aerospace knowledge and focus on advances in aerospace
technology. Started in 1952, these workshops have reached hundreds
of thousands of young people. Civil Air Patrol also plans and
executes the National Congress on Aviation and Space Education.
This is the premier aerospace education conference held in the
nation.</P>

<P class="normal">Civil Air Patrol is perhaps best known for
its search and rescue efforts. CAP now flies more than 85 percent
of all inland search and rescue missions directed by the Air Force
Rescue Coordination Center, saving more than 100 people per year.</P>

<P class="normal">CAP is actively involved in disaster relief.
During the Northridge earthquake in California, Civil Air Patrol
was there to help. Civil Air Patrol was also there to help during
the &quot;Great&quot; 1993 flood.</P>

<P class="normal">During World War II, Civil Air Patrol trained
thousands of young men to fly before they joined the Army Air
Forces. This training was coupled with positive values, resulting
in a pool of aviators ready to battle. After the war, Congress
was convinced that a peacetime cadet program would pay great dividends.</P>

<P class="normal">To join Civil Air Patrol one must be between
11 and 18. A grade point average of 2.0 is required. The leadership,
discipline and other skills will enable one to be successful as
an adult. Every year, CAP holds an Encampment, a 9-day basic training
in which cadets are exposed to intense leadership training. Time
management, teamwork, physical fitness, and self-discipline are
all part of the training. The cadets also have the opportunity
to attend a number of different events including Flight Academy;
Officer School; and International Air Cadet Exchange, where a
cadet visits another country. There are many opportunities for
today&#146;s children to better themselves in the Civil Air Patrol.</P>
