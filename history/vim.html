<h1>Background</h1>
   In the modern era of computing, modeless text editors like GNU EMACS or
 the Microsoft Notepad are becoming more and more common. In such editors, 
 the data is always opeen to modification; editor commands are given through 
 key combinations consisting of a modifier (Control, Alternate, Meta) pressed 
 simultaneously with a function key (generally any non-modifier, most often 
 a letter or number key). Some modeless editors even have menus which make 
 commands available through the use of the mouse.<br>
   <br>
   In contrast to EMACS and Notepad, editors like Vim and its relatives (<tt>
  ed</tt>, <tt>vi</tt>, <tt>elvis</tt>) are <i>modal</i>--data is only modified 
 when the editor is placed in <i>edit mode</i>. At all other times, any keypresses 
 are interpreted as commands. This may seem confusing to newcomers... and 
indeed, new users of Vim will often make the mistake of adding the text ":q!" 
to their files or telling the editor to save and quit when they wish to refer 
 to the band 'ZZ Top'!<br>
   <br>
   The purpose of this tutorial is to make new users comfortable enough with 
 Vim that these mistakes no longer occur. Why bother learning Vim when an 
alternative like EMACS is available and perhaps more intuitive? There are 
several reasons:<br>
   
<ul>
    <li>EMACS is much less intuitive than it initially seems. The editor
is  a very complicated system, and it takes a significant amount of memorization
 to master all of the command keystrokes. It may be simple to start EMACS,
 type "Hi mom!" and then the key combination Ctrl-X-Ctrl-S to save and quit,
 but there is more to a text editor than typing, saving and quiting.</li>
    <li>While EMACS is very popular, surveys have shown <tt>vi</tt> and its
 variants to be <i>more</i> popular; familiarity with Vim will bring immediate
 familiarity with most of these variants. It is virtually guaranteed that
some variant of <tt>vi</tt> will be available on any UNIX system.</li>
    <li>The presence of a <i>command mode</i> in Vim allows more intuitive
 control of the editor. As stated above, the command to save and quit from
 an EMACS session is Ctrl-X-Ctrl-S. In Vim, typing <b><tt>:write</tt></b>
 and then <b><tt>:quit</tt></b> will achieve the same result. These commands
can also be abbreviated, so <b><tt>:wq</tt></b> achieves the same result.&nbsp;</li>
   
</ul>
  By following the steps in this tutorial, a user will be able to perform 
operations on text files at a level sufficient for most power-users.<br>
   
<h1>Conventions</h1>
  As with virtually any computer program, Vim expects a certain amount of 
user input. It is important that input specified in this document is entered 
exactly as it is presented, or unexpected results may occur. To distinguish 
expected input from the body of this document, all commands that should be 
entered into Vim will be presented in a bold <b><tt>fixed-width font</tt></b>
 . If the words "fixed-width font" did not appear different from the rest 
of this paragraph, be sure to set the browser's fixed-width font display setting
to a different font than that specified by the variable-width font setting.
 To avoid confusion about punction or other special characters, any commands
that contain these characters will be enclosed in quotes. Unless otherwise
specified, the quotes should <i>not</i> be typed. Finally, all commands should
be followed by a newline character; most modern Unices will insert this character
when the user presses "Return" or "Enter". However, it is possible that a
different key will yield the same result. Contact a system administrator
in the event of trouble.  
<h1>Escape Key</h1>
  The Escape key is perhaps the most important key in a Vim session. On most
 systems, this key is located in the upper left region of the keyboard, and
 is imprinted with the letters "<tt>Esc</tt>". When Vim is in <i>edit mode</i>
  , Escape will enter <i>command mode</i> and wait for any user commands. 
While entering a command in <i>command mode</i>, Escape will erase the typed 
portion of the command, effectively resetting <i>command mode</i>.<br>
<h1>Multipliers and Ranges</h1>
 In order to improve efficiency, most commands respect multipliers, and most
commands dealing with whole lines respect ranges. As one might assume, command
multipliers will repeat the specified action a given number of times. Likewise,
command ranges will repeat the specified command on all lines that fall within
the line range (inclusive).<br>
<br>
Multipliers are specified as a number before a command. For instance, <b><tt>
6x</tt></b> will perform a character delete 6 times. Ranges are specified
as two numbers before the command, separated by a comma: <b><tt>25,32dd</tt></b>
 deletes all lines between 25 and 32, inclusive. Where this behavior seems
nonobvious, a discussion of the actual behavior will accompany a command.<br>
   
<h1>Basic Commands</h1>
  Among the most basic commands are those that move the cursor or delete
characters.  In addition to using the arrow keys to move the cursor, it can
be useful to use these navigation keys in <i>command mode</i>:<br>
   
<ul>
    <li><b><tt>h j k l</tt></b> moves the cursor left one character, down 
one line, up one line, or right one characer, respectively.</li>
   
</ul>
   
<ul>
    <li><b><tt>w e b</tt></b> moves the cursor forward one word, to the end
 of the current word, or back one word, respectively. Note that words are
NOT defined as they are in English! A Vim "word" is any collection of contiguous
 alphanumeric characters or any collection of contiguous non-alphanumeric
characters. Hence, the following three strings each count as three words
in Vim:      
    <ol>
  <li><tt>don't</tt></li>
  <li><tt>don'''t</tt></li>
  <li><tt>don' t</tt></li>
       
    </ol>
   </li>
    <li><tt><b>W E B</b></tt> behave like their lowercase equivalents, only 
a "word" is any number of continguous non-whitespace characters. Often, this 
can be more in line with the English definition of a word, but be careful!&nbsp;</li>
   
</ul>
 Vim would be useless if it were only possible to move the cursor. The following 
keys all perform actions on the character under the cursor:<br>
 
<ul>
   <li><tt><b>r</b></tt> switches to <i>edit mode</i>, replaces the character 
with the next character typed, and returns to <i>command mode</i>.</li>
   <li><b><tt>i</tt> </b>switches to <i>edit mode</i> so that all text entered 
will be inserted <i>before</i> the position of the cursor.</li>
   <li><tt><b>a</b></tt> moves the cursor one character to the right and
then performs the same function as <tt><b>i</b></tt>. The effect is the same
as inserting text <i>after</i> the original position of the cursor.</li>
   <li><tt><b>x</b></tt> deletes the character.</li>
 
</ul>
 To avoid the tedium of using <tt><b>x</b></tt> for deleting characters,
the <tt><b>d</b></tt> command controls more sophisticated deletion. <b><tt>
d</tt></b> has multiple forms:<br>
<ul>
  <li><b><tt>dw</tt></b> deletes a portion of the word, starting at the cursor
and continuing to the end.</li>
  <li><tt><b>dd</b></tt> deletes the line the curor is on.</li>
  <li><b><tt>d$</tt></b> deletes all characters between the position of the
cursor and the end of the line, inclusive.</li>
  <li><b><tt>dG</tt></b> deletes all lines from the cursor to the end of
the file.</li>
</ul>
